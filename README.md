# Tiny Kitchen

Tiny Kitchen is a recipe organizer and intelligent kitchen assistant. Our app guides you through the cooking process by providing an AI cooking assistant named Mochi.  Mochi can read recipe steps, sets timers, and performs unit conversions based on voice commands. Users can add recipes to their own personal recipe boxes, add notes to recipes, and manage a grocery list. With our chrome extension users can add recipes from their favorite cooking sites to their recipe boxes.
