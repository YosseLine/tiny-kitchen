Tiny Kitchen is a recipe organizer and intelligent kitchen assistant. Our app guides the user through the cooking process by providing an AI cooking assistant named Mochi. Mochi can read recipe steps, sets timers, and performs unit conversions based on voice commands. Users can add recipes to their own personal recipe boxes, add notes to recipes, and manage a grocery list. With our chrome extension users can add recipes from their favorite cooking sites.

    * To control Mochi's reading, you can say: 'start cooking', 'start', 'stop', or 'pause'
    * You can ask him unit conversion questions: e.g. 'what is one tablespoon to teaspoons', or 'convert one tablespoon to teaspoons'
    * You can also set a timer: e.g. 'set a timer for 5 minutes'
